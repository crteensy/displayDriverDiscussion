Display Capabilities
=

Regardless of their physical properties, displays have different drawing capabilities.
The display driver should propagate them to the canvas, which can then make use of them.

These capabilities can be:
- Drawing primitives,
- pixel-wise read access for special drawing functionality (XOR pen or stuff like that),
- Clipping,
- Shifting,
- Filling,
- (lots more)
